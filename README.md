# ProTranslator

We provided the codes of ProTranslator here, including zero shot, few shot, annotating genesset to pathways and generation of texts from geneset.

The key idea of our method ProTranslator is to redefine protein function prediction as a machine translation problem, which translates the description word sequence of a function to the amino acid sequence of a protein. We can then transfer annotations from functions that have similar textual description to annotate a novel function.
